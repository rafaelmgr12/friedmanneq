# Friedmann Equations
This code solves Friedmann's equations numerically, from the general case to some particulars. Code written in C where we use Runge-Kutta methods to solve the differential equations.

To compile this set, use 
'''
**gcc friedmann.c -lm**
'''

There is also a python routine for plotting graphs, but it is incomplete.
